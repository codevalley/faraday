# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Personal Semantic Engine (Faraday) is a comprehensive API-based web service that enables users to create a unified, searchable repository of their personal data. The system ingests plain English thoughts and connects to various structured APIs (health, digital wellbeing, social media, location, etc.) to build a semantic understanding of the user's life. It provides timeline visualization and intelligent search capabilities across all personal data sources by extracting entities such as dates, locations, people, activities, and emotions from raw input.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input my thoughts in plain English with optional metadata, so that I can capture my personal experiences and reflections in a natural way with contextual information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits plain English text THEN the system SHALL accept and store the raw input with a timestamp
2. WHEN text is submitted with optional metadata THEN the system SHALL capture and store location, weather, and other contextual information
3. WHEN text is submitted THEN the system SHALL extract entities including dates, locations, people, activities, and emotions
4. WHEN entity extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL create multiple linked semantic entries from a single input note if multiple concepts are identified
5. WHEN semantic entries are created THEN the system SHALL store them with references to the original text and maintain relationships between linked entries
6. IF the text input exceeds reasonable limits THEN the system SHALL reject the input with an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search across all my personal data using natural language queries with filtering options, so that I can quickly find relevant information from my life history with precise control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a search query THEN the system SHALL perform semantic search across all ingested data
2. WHEN search results are generated THEN the system SHALL rank results by relevance and recency
3. WHEN displaying search results THEN the system SHALL highlight matching entities and provide context
4. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by specific entity types (dates, locations, people, activities, emotions)
5. WHEN filters are active THEN the system SHALL only return results matching the selected entity type criteria
6. IF no results are found THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative search terms or related entities
7. WHEN search is performed THEN the system SHALL return results within 2 seconds for optimal user experience

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my personal data in a timeline format, so that I can visualize the chronological progression of my experiences and activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests timeline view THEN the system SHALL display data chronologically with configurable time ranges
2. WHEN timeline is rendered THEN the system SHALL group related events and show connections between different data sources
3. WHEN viewing timeline entries THEN the system SHALL display extracted entities as interactive elements
4. IF timeline data is extensive THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or lazy loading for performance
5. WHEN timeline is displayed THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by entity types, date ranges, and data sources

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage user accounts through administrative endpoints, so that I can maintain the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses administrative functions THEN the system SHALL require proper authentication and authorization
2. WHEN managing user accounts THEN the system SHALL provide CRUD operations for user management
3. IF administrative operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and maintain audit logs
4. WHEN system health is checked THEN the system SHALL provide status information for core system services

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my personal data to be stored securely and privately, so that I can trust the system with sensitive information about my life.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information at rest
2. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use secure protocols (HTTPS/TLS)
3. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL implement secure authentication mechanisms
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and implement rate limiting
5. WHEN data is processed THEN the system SHALL ensure user data isolation and prevent cross-user data access

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to interact with the system through well-documented REST APIs, so that I can build applications and integrations on top of the personal semantic engine.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide consistent REST API responses with proper HTTP status codes
2. WHEN API documentation is requested THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL implement proper rate limiting and authentication
4. IF API requests are malformed THEN the system SHALL return descriptive error messages with guidance
5. WHEN API responses are generated THEN the system SHALL include appropriate metadata and pagination information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect various external APIs to my personal data repository, so that I can have a comprehensive view of my digital life.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures an API connection THEN the system SHALL authenticate and establish a secure connection to the external service
2. WHEN an API connection is active THEN the system SHALL periodically sync data from health, digital wellbeing, social media, and location services
3. WHEN external data is ingested THEN the system SHALL normalize and store it in a consistent format
4. IF an API connection fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN API data is processed THEN the system SHALL extract relevant entities and link them to user thoughts where applicable
