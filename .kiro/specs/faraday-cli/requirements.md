# Faraday CLI Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Faraday CLI is a command-line interface for the Personal Semantic Engine that allows users to interact with their thoughts, perform semantic searches, and manage their personal knowledge base directly from the terminal. This CLI will provide a fast, efficient way to capture thoughts, search through them, and analyze patterns without needing to use the web API directly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Thought Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create, view, and manage my thoughts from the command line, so that I can quickly capture ideas without leaving my terminal workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `faraday add "my thought content"` THEN the system SHALL create a new thought with the provided content
2. WHEN I run `faraday add "content" --mood happy --tags work,idea` THEN the system SHALL create a thought with metadata
3. WHEN I run `faraday list` THEN the system SHALL display my recent thoughts in a readable format
4. WHEN I run `faraday list --limit 10` THEN the system SHALL display the 10 most recent thoughts
5. WHEN I run `faraday show <thought-id>` THEN the system SHALL display the full thought details including entities
6. WHEN I run `faraday delete <thought-id>` THEN the system SHALL remove the thought after confirmation

### Requirement 2: Semantic Search

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search through my thoughts using natural language queries, so that I can quickly find relevant information from my knowledge base.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `faraday search "coffee meetings"` THEN the system SHALL return thoughts semantically related to coffee meetings
2. WHEN I run `faraday search "AI projects" --limit 5` THEN the system SHALL return up to 5 most relevant thoughts
3. WHEN I run `faraday search "work" --mood excited` THEN the system SHALL filter results by mood
4. WHEN I run `faraday search "collaboration" --tags work` THEN the system SHALL filter results by tags
5. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show relevance scores and highlight key matches

### Requirement 3: User Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate with the CLI tool, so that I can securely access my personal thoughts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `faraday login` THEN the system SHALL prompt for email and password
2. WHEN I provide valid credentials THEN the system SHALL store authentication token locally
3. WHEN I run `faraday logout` THEN the system SHALL clear stored authentication
4. WHEN I run commands without authentication THEN the system SHALL prompt me to login first
5. WHEN authentication token expires THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication

### Requirement 4: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure the CLI to connect to my Faraday instance, so that I can use it with different servers or local installations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `faraday config set api-url http://localhost:8001` THEN the system SHALL update the API endpoint
2. WHEN I run `faraday config show` THEN the system SHALL display current configuration
3. WHEN I run `faraday config reset` THEN the system SHALL restore default configuration
4. WHEN configuration file doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it with defaults
5. WHEN API endpoint is unreachable THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages

### Requirement 5: Interactive Mode

**User Story:** As a user, I want an interactive mode for the CLI, so that I can have a conversational experience when exploring my thoughts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `faraday interactive` THEN the system SHALL start an interactive session
2. WHEN in interactive mode AND I type "add: my thought" THEN the system SHALL create a thought
3. WHEN in interactive mode AND I type "search: coffee" THEN the system SHALL perform a search
4. WHEN in interactive mode AND I type "help" THEN the system SHALL show available commands
5. WHEN in interactive mode AND I type "exit" THEN the system SHALL close the session

### Requirement 6: Data Export and Import

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export and import my thoughts, so that I can backup my data or migrate between instances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `faraday export thoughts.json` THEN the system SHALL export all my thoughts to JSON
2. WHEN I run `faraday export --format csv thoughts.csv` THEN the system SHALL export to CSV format
3. WHEN I run `faraday import thoughts.json` THEN the system SHALL import thoughts from JSON file
4. WHEN importing duplicate thoughts THEN the system SHALL ask for conflict resolution
5. WHEN export/import operations are large THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators

### Requirement 7: Analytics and Insights

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see analytics about my thoughts and patterns, so that I can gain insights into my thinking and productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `faraday stats` THEN the system SHALL show thought count, most common tags, and mood distribution
2. WHEN I run `faraday timeline` THEN the system SHALL show a timeline of my thought activity
3. WHEN I run `faraday entities` THEN the system SHALL show most frequently mentioned people, places, and topics
4. WHEN I run `faraday mood-trend` THEN the system SHALL show mood patterns over time
5. WHEN displaying analytics THEN the system SHALL use charts and visual representations where helpful

### Requirement 8: Offline Capabilities

**User Story:** As a user, I want basic offline functionality, so that I can capture thoughts even when not connected to the server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I'm offline AND run `faraday add "thought"` THEN the system SHALL queue the thought locally
2. WHEN connection is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically sync queued thoughts
3. WHEN I run `faraday sync` THEN the system SHALL manually trigger synchronization
4. WHEN there are sync conflicts THEN the system SHALL prompt for resolution
5. WHEN offline AND I search THEN the system SHALL search through locally cached thoughts

### Requirement 9: Rich Output Formatting

**User Story:** As a user, I want beautifully formatted output from the CLI, so that information is easy to read and understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying thoughts THEN the system SHALL use colors and formatting for readability
2. WHEN showing search results THEN the system SHALL highlight matching terms
3. WHEN displaying tables THEN the system SHALL align columns and use borders
